🏗️ Proposed Architecture
Data Flow & Integration Strategy:

Student/Counselor → MainServer (Session Creation + Auth)
                        ↓ (Creates chat session metadata)
                   ChatService ← Session Context
                        ↓ (Direct WebSocket for real-time)
                   Student ↔ Counselor Chat
                        ↓ (Session events)
                   Redis (message queue + TTL storage)
                        ↓ (Offline user detection)
                   FCM Service (push notifications)
                        ↓ (Notification to offline users)


Simple Set-by step process of what happens:
#Step1: student logs in
Student opens app → Enters credentials → MainServer validates → JWT token created

#Step2: student chooses a book:
Student sees list of available counselors (like books in a library)
Student clicks "Talk to this counselor"

    What happens:

    Frontend sends request: "I want to chat with counselor X"
    MainServer checks: "Is this counselor available? Is student allowed?"

#Step 3: Main Server creates a chat room ticket:
MainServer creates a chat session:
- Session ID: "chat_12345"
- Student: "anonymous_student_abc" (hides real identity)
- Counselor: "counselor_john"
- Valid for: 24 hours
Think of it like:

    MainServer is like a librarian
    Creates a private reading room
    Gives both people a ticket to enter
    Only those with tickets can enter


#Step 4: Opening the Chat Room Door:
MainServer tells Student: 
"Here's your chat ticket (new JWT) and the room address (ChatService URL)"

Student's frontend: 
"OK, let me connect to that chat room with my ticket"

#Step 5: Entering the Chat Room:
Student connects to ChatService → Shows ticket (JWT)
ChatService checks: "Is this ticket valid? Which room should I put you in?"
ChatService: "Welcome! You're now in room chat_12345"

#Step 6: Real-time Chat:
Student and Counselor exchange messages in real-time:
    Student types: "Hello, I need help with anxiety"
    ↓
    ChatService receives message
    ↓
    Stores message in Redis (like a temporary notepad)
    ↓
    Sends message to Counselor (if online)

#Step 7: Offline Handling:
    ChatService notices: "Counselor not connected"
    ↓
    Sends push notification to counselor's phone
    ↓
    Message waits in Redis until counselor comes online

#Step 8: Counselor Responds:
    Counselor opens app → Gets recent messages from Redis
    ↓
    Both can now chat in real-time
    ↓
    All messages auto-delete after 24 hours


🎯 Key Points in Simple Terms:
Why Two Servers?
    MainServer: The "librarian" - manages who can talk to whom
    ChatService: The "reading room" - handles the actual conversation
Why Redis?
    Like a temporary notepad that auto-erases
    Stores messages for 24 hours then deletes automatically
    Helps send messages between people instantly
Why Anonymous IDs?
    Student's real name stays hidden from ChatService
    Only MainServer knows real identity
    Counselor sees "anonymous_student_abc" instead of real name
The "Human Library" Flow:
    Browse available "books" (counselors)
    "Check out" a book (request chat session)
    Get private "reading room" (chat session)
    Have conversation with your chosen "book"
    Session expires automatically (24h)


My questions:
in step 4, is a new JWT generated or is the current JWT of the student having logged in passed on?
how is the chatservice URL made?I understand the baseUrl would be that of the java main chat server running...

in step 5, how is the JWT being recognized, the fact the JWT being made in the mainServer, is it temporarily stored in Redis? 
Is it the same place (the place which holds the JWT in the redis have all the session's messages?)
{nevermind what I said if we didnt use redis for this...If the transfer of JWT happens in such a way, let's name 
this place chatTransferRoom which would essentially also be storing our messages right?}

is it that the JWT and the chatservice URL are tied to each other? because I shouldnt be able to enter any 
room with a different URL right?

Also wrt to session Ending I was thinking after the chatTransferRoom has no further messages for 24 hrs, 
we delete the entire chat.

Answers to my Questions:
🎫 Step 4: JWT Generation
A NEW JWT is generated specifically for chat
code:
// MainServer after creating chat session
    const chatJWT = jwt.sign({
    // Original user info
    userId: originalJWT.userId,
    role: originalJWT.role, // "student" or "counselor"
    
    // NEW chat-specific info
    sessionId: "chat_12345",
    anonymousId: "anon_student_abc",
    chatPermissions: ["send_message", "view_history"],
    
    // Chat service specific
    chatServiceUrl: "ws://chatservice:8080",
    
    exp: Date.now() + 24*60*60*1000 // 24h expiry
    }, SHARED_JWT_SECRET);

    // Response to frontend
    res.json({
    chatToken: chatJWT,  // NEW token for chat
    chatServiceUrl: "ws://chatservice:8080/session/chat_12345"
    });

Why new JWT?
    Original JWT has general app permissions
    Chat JWT has specific session permissions
    Chat JWT contains anonymous ID (privacy)
    Different expiry times

🌐 ChatService URL Construction
// MainServer constructs the URL
const chatServiceBaseUrl = process.env.CHAT_SERVICE_URL; // "ws://chatservice:8080"
const chatServiceUrl = `${chatServiceBaseUrl}/session/${sessionId}`;

// Final URL: "ws://chatservice:8080/session/chat_12345"

🔑 Step 5: JWT Recognition & Storage
JWT is NOT stored in Redis. Here's the flow:
THE JWT is verified with the help of the same shared secret used by both servers.


🔗 JWT & ChatService URL Relationship
YES, they are tied together for security:
Security benefit:
    Can't use JWT for session A to access session B
    URL and JWT must match exactly


#Step 0:
First step would be to create different types of roles for the users=>student,volunteer,counsellor
    const jwt_payload = {
        userId: "user_123",
        isAdmin: false,
        isCounselor: true,  // NEW field
        role: "counselor",  // NEW field for clarity
        // ... other fields
    };

LLD Chat Storage and retrieval from Redis:
Each chat session has the session metaData which is stored first, along with which there is a list or vector or dictionary (best case if not wrong would be a set). This would be a growing set structure.

we could go one step further create a key which has the meta data which has the student anonymous ID, the counselorId and then a random number which is prefixed by the chat sessionId creating a new string => chatsessionXXXX|YYYY.(yyy being the random nos. being generated). The meta data would also have a chatExpiresIn
We could create another redis key with this string(name it as chatStringLists(not in the redis - but for our convenience)),and keep pushing to this list as and when new messages are added.
Each message added would be in the form of a special struct having the msgContent, time of Delivery,who sent it.
With each message also coming in, we could update this chatexpiresIn with the new value. It would set a value of expiry for both the associated list and the chat metadata.
So with two redis accesses, we can access the whole chat.

Composite Key Structure:
// Instead of: "chat_12345|789" (random suffix serves no purpose)
// Use: "messageList:chat_12345" (clear and direct)

const sessionId = "chat_12345";
const metadataKey = `${sessionId}:metadata`;
const messagesKey = `messageList:${sessionId}`;

📦 Clean Redis Structure:
// For session "chat_12345":
Redis Keys:
├── "chat_12345:metadata" → {sessionMetadata + chatExpiresIn}
└── "messageList:chat_12345" → [msg1, msg2, msg3, ...] // Message list

Complete redis structure:
    // For session "chat_12345":
    Redis Keys:
    ├── "chat_12345:metadata" → {
    │     studentAnonymousId: "anon_student_abc",
    │     counselorId: "counselor_john", 
    │     createdAt: timestamp,
    │     chatExpiresIn: timestamp + 24h,
    │     status: "active"
    │   }
    └── "messageList:chat_12345" → [
        '{"content":"Hello","timestamp":123,"sender":"anon_student_abc"}',
        '{"content":"Hi there","timestamp":124,"sender":"counselor_john"}',
        // ... more messages
    ]

TTL Update Strategy:
When a new message arrives, update the TTL for both keys:
    // On each new message:
    const updateChatExpiry = async (chatStringLists) => {
    const newExpiryTime = Date.now() + (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 24h from now
    
    // Update metadata with new expiry
    await redis.hset(`${chatStringLists}:metadata`, 'chatExpiresIn', newExpiryTime);
    
    // Reset TTL for both keys
    await redis.expire(`${chatStringLists}:metadata`, 86400);
    await redis.expire(`${chatStringLists}:messages`, 86400);
    };

messageStructure in List:
    // Each message in the list:
    const messageStruct = {
    content: "Hello, I need help",
    timestamp: 1703123456789,
    sender: "anon_student_abc", // or "counselor_john"
    type: "text" // future: "image", "file", etc.
    };

    // Stored as JSON string in Redis list:
    await redis.rpush(`${chatStringLists}:messages`, JSON.stringify(messageStruct));


LLM Integration:
Regarding the LLM summarization, only if the counsellor wants to have a summary and wants to connect the anonymous username to a particular student's issues. The LLM also woudl use the previous document if present for the particular student. These documents are stored in mongodb. Im assumming calling such a summarizer would take atleast 30s. So, Would it be better if we use some sort of queueing strategy here?
Im planning to use Gemini here...

// Better flow:
Chat Session End → Redis Event → Background Queue → LLM Worker
                                      ↓ (async processing)
                             MongoDB Summary Storage
                                      ↓ (notification)
                           Counselor Dashboard Update
